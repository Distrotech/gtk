A widget for custom user interface elements

<para>

The #GtkDrawingArea widget is used for creating custom user interface
elements. It's essentially a blank widget; you can draw on
<literal>widget-&gt;window</literal>. After creating a drawing area,
the application may want to connect to:

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
    Mouse and button press signals to respond to input from
    the user. (Use gtk_widget_add_events() to enable events 
    you wish to receive.)
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
    The "realize" signal to take any necessary actions
    when the widget is instantiated on a particular display.
    (Create GDK resources in response to this signal.)
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
    The "configure_event" signal to take any necessary actions
    when the widget changes size.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
    The "draw" signal to handle redrawing the contents of the
    widget.
    </para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>
The following code portion demonstrates using a drawing
area to display a circle in the normal widget foreground 
color.
Note that GDK automatically clears the exposed area
to the background color before sending the expose event, and 
that drawing is implicitly clipped to the exposed area.

<para>
Draw signals are normally delivered when a drawing area first comes
onscreen, or when it's covered by another window and then uncovered.
You can also force a redraw by adding to the "damage region" of the
drawing area's window; use gtk_widget_queue_draw_area() to do this. 
You'll then get a draw event for the invalid region.
</para>

<para>
The available routines for drawing are documented on the <link
linkend="gdk3-Cairo-Interaction">GDK Drawing Primitives</link> page
and the cairo documentation.
</para>

<para>
To receive mouse events on a drawing area, you will need to enable
them with gtk_widget_add_events(). To receive keyboard events, you
will need to set the #GTK_CAN_FOCUS flag on the drawing area, and
should probably draw some user-visible indication that the drawing
area is focused. Use the GTK_HAS_FOCUS() macro in your expose event
handler to decide whether to draw the focus indicator. See
gtk_paint_focus() for one way to draw focus.

<!-- ##### SECTION See_Also ##### -->
<para>
Sometimes #GtkImage is a useful alternative to a drawing area. 
You can put a #GdkPixmap in the #GtkImage and draw to the #GdkPixmap, 
calling gtk_widget_queue_draw() on the #GtkImage when you want to 
refresh to the screen.
